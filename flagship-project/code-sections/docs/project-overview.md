This project simulates the release of a small internal system enhancement intended
to improve operational visibility and reliability.

The goal of the release is to introduce better monitoring and reporting without
disrupting existing users or workflows. The documentation in this folder mirrors
what would typically be required before approving a production release in an
enterprise environment.

Rather than focusing on feature complexity, this project emphasizes clarity,
accountability, and readiness.
