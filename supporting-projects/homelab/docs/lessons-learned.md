# Lessons Learned

Working on this HomeLab reinforced how valuable simple, well-organized systems
are. Keeping the setup small and modular made it easier to understand, change,
and maintain over time.

## Simplicity helps
Avoiding unnecessary complexity made problems easier to diagnose and changes
easier to apply. Clear structure mattered more than adding features.

## Writing things down matters
Documenting the setup forced decisions to be more intentional. When something
was hard to explain, it usually meant it could be simplified.

## Good defaults go a long way
Most security improvements came from basic choices like limiting exposure,
isolating services, and keeping secrets out of the codebase.

## Thinking operationally
Considering monitoring, backups, and recovery early helped shape better design
decisions, even in a small environment.

## Looking ahead
This HomeLab is meant to evolve. The structure and approach can be reused or
rebuilt as needs change.
