# HomeLab Overview

This HomeLab is a personal project used to explore and practice how a small,
self-managed infrastructure environment can be designed and operated.

Instead of focusing on specific hardware or always-on services, the lab is meant
to model how a realistic home or personal server setup would be organized,
secured, and maintained. The emphasis is on understanding how different pieces
fit together rather than running a production system full-time.

The lab can be run in a simulated setup using local tools such as Docker Desktop,
which allows experimentation without requiring dedicated hardware.

## Purpose
The purpose of this HomeLab is to:
- Learn how to structure and organize services
- Practice basic networking and access control concepts
- Think through security and reliability concerns
- Document decisions and tradeoffs clearly

## Scope
This HomeLab focuses on:
- Logical system design instead of physical equipment
- Service isolation and configuration
- Security-conscious defaults
- Monitoring and backup planning

It does not aim to be:
- A high-availability or production-grade environment
- A replacement for enterprise infrastructure
- A showcase of hardware performance

## Using this project
The documentation in the `docs/` directory describes each part of the HomeLab in
detail. Files can be read individually, but together they describe the overall
design and reasoning behind the setup.
